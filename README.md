# sjmona.github.io

This is a ready-to-publish portfolio starter for GitHub Pages.

## How to publish
1. Create a new public repository named **sjmona.github.io** on your GitHub account.
2. Upload all files from this folder to the repo root (index.html must be at the root).
3. Commit the changes. Your site will be live at `https://sjmona.github.io` within a minute.
4. Edit content directly in **index.html** and replace images in `assets/`.

## Optional
- Replace `assets/Mona_Sajedi_CV.pdf` with your actual CV.
- Update the contact form: change the Formspree endpoint (`https://formspree.io/f/your-id`) or use a `mailto:` action.
- Add new project pages inside a `/projects` folder (create it) and link them from the grid.
